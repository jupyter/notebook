# Changelog

A summary of changes in the Jupyter notebook. For more detailed
information, see [GitHub](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook).

Use `pip install notebook --upgrade` or `conda upgrade notebook` to
upgrade to the latest release.

We strongly recommend that you upgrade pip to version 9+ of pip before
upgrading `notebook`.

Use `pip install pip --upgrade` to upgrade pip. Check pip version with
`pip --version`.

## 7.4

Jupyter Notebook 7.4 is based on JupyterLab 4.4, and includes a number of new features, bug fixes, and enhancements for extension developers. This release is compatible with extensions supporting JupyterLab 4.0. Extension authors are recommended to consult the [Extension Migration Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html#jupyterlab-4-3-to-4-4) which lists deprecations and changes to the public API.

Below are a few highlights for this new release. Most of the new features and improvements come from the update to JupyterLab 4.4, although they may not all be supported in Notebook 7.4.

For reference you may have a look at the [JupyterLab 4.4 changelog](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/changelog.html#v4-4) to learn more.

### Code console improvements

The code console prompt can now be positioned on the top, left, or right side of the console,
in addition to the default bottom placement. The placement is persisted in the Prompt Cell
Position setting.

The console toolbar now includes buttons to:
- Execute code
- Restart the kernel
- Clear the cells
- Switch the kernel

<img alt="The option to change console prompt position is available under the three dots button in the console toolbar, which is the last toolbar button" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f5a82a-0dd2-439b-a520-d04c73363bfe" class="jp-screenshot">

Additional settings for console behavior have been added:
- Clear Code Content on Execute (enabled by default) – When disabled, the code submitted for execution remains in the code editor, allowing for further edits.
- Hide Code Input – When enabled, only the execution output is shown in the console.
- Clear Cells on Execute – When enabled, only the last cell is displayed.

Toggling all the three new settings transforms the console into an interactive editor
resembling an ephemeral notebook with a single cell.

### Settings import and export

Settings can now be exported to `overrides.json` from the Settings Editor,
which can be used to pre-configure defaults in deployments or to restore settings.

<img alt="The Import and Export buttons in the Settings Editor are the first two items in the toolbar panel" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.4-settings-import-export.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Support for collaboration without `RTC:` drive

Real time collaboration in previous versions of JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook
(which can be enabled by installing jupyter-collaboration package)
was implemented by swapping the default JupyterLab file system
drive to a collaborative drive with the `RTC:` prefix.
This approach was incompatible with multiple extensions.
JupyterLab 4.4 introduces the Content Providers API, which allows the next version of `jupyter-collaboration` to work without changing the drive prefix.
This improves compatibility with extensions that do not support arbitrary drives.

### Context menu opt-out

The context menu, available under right mouse click in browsers, can now be disabled globally
by toggling the `Enable Context Menu` option available in the Command Palette,
or via the JSON Settings Editor in the Application Context Menu.

## 7.3

Jupyter Notebook 7.3 is based on JupyterLab 4.3, and includes a number of new features, bug fixes, and enhancements for extension developers. This release is compatible with extensions supporting JupyterLab 4.0. Extension authors are recommended to consult the [Extension Migration Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html#jupyterlab-4-2-to-4-3) which lists deprecations and changes to the public API.

Below are a few highlights for this new release. Most of the new features and improvements come from the update to JupyterLab 4.3, although they may not all be supported in Notebook 7.3.

For reference you may have a look at the [JupyterLab 4.3 changelog](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/changelog.html#v4-3) to learn more.

### Minimap

The virtual scrollbar now acts as a minimap and exposes information on whether a cell:

- is running/scheduled (`[*]`), idle (`[ ]`) or was already run (e.g. `[1]`)
- was modified since it was last executed (“dirty”) - orange background
- has an output that contains an error - red background
- is markdown/code (`[ ]`/`[*]`/`[1]` for code, nothing for markdown)
- how much text/code it contains

![a screenshot showing the notebook minimap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.3-minimap.png)

To enable the minimap, click on the hamburger icon (≡) which appears in the notebook’s toolbar. If you do not see the hamburger icon, go to `Settings → Notebook → Windowing mode` and choose “full”.

### File browser enhancements

The file browser now:

- supports resizing the columns and remembers the column sizes after reloading JupyterLab
- supports uploading folders by drag-and-drop
- supports navigation with a single click
- adds a file filter collapsed by default (funnel icon)

![a screenshot showing that it's now possible to resize the file browser columns](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0d9cd0a-2828-43f7-a922-e8b271e5f7fc)

In Jupyter Notebook, the single click navigation is enabled by default. If you would like to disable it to get the same experience as in JupyterLab, go to `Settings → File Browser` and make sure "Navigate files and directories with single click" is unchecked.

### Improved kernel and server interactions

The previous release enabled connecting to external kernels, such as those spawned by a third-party application like Blender. In this release the kernel selector dialog was improved to also show the external kernels.

The previous release improved the awareness of the kernel/kernel specification distinction by providing both tree and list view in the kernels sidebar panel, but only the tree view featured the kernel identifiers. In this release both the list and tree view show the kernel identifier stub.

A new toolbar button was added in the kernel allowing to shut down unused kernels (kernels with no widget attached).

![a screenshot showing the list view of the kernels in the sidebar](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7f958c5-4054-4b09-8fad-4df6db8c9b58)

### Full Width Notebook

It is now possible to configure the notebook to take up the full width of the page via:

- a setting that can be defined by a user via the Settings Editor
- the `View > Enable Full Width Notebook` menu entry
- the command palette, searching for `Enable Full Width Notebook`

![a screenshot showing how to enable full width notebook via the menu](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/148b227a-874a-4bb3-a4c6-c7350525ccc4)

This is particularly useful on large displays, or for those who prefer working with a wider notebook.

It is also possible to use the JupyterLab interface for a more fully-featured experience, which allows for full-width notebooks too, and offers a "Simple Interface" mode for only showing a single notebook at a time.

You can open JupyterLab by clicking on `View > Open JupyterLab`.

## 7.2

Jupyter Notebook 7.2 is based on JupyterLab 4.2, and includes a number of new features, bug fixes, and enhancements for extension developers. This release is compatible with extensions supporting JupyterLab 4.0. Extension authors are recommended to consult the [Extension Migration Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html#jupyterlab-4-0-to-4-1) which lists deprecations and changes to the public API.

Below are a few highlights for this new release. Most of the new features and improvements come from the update to JupyterLab 4.2, although they are not all supported in Notebook 7.2.

For reference you may have a look at the JupyterLab 4.2 changelog to learn more: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/changelog.html#v4-2

### Full notebook windowing mode by default

Notebooks in the `full` windowing mode only render the visible cells, significantly improving the performance of the application. One limitation of `full` mode is that the search function in your browser may produce false negatives; using the search function is recommended. To revert to the behaviour from Notebook 7.2, go to Settings → Settings Editor → Notebook, scroll to “Windowing mode”, and choose `defer`.

### Improved Shortcuts Editor

Among the numerous improvements and bug fixes for the keyboard shortcuts editor:

- it is now possible to remove the default shortcuts,
- shortcuts are correctly sorted when using a language pack,
- shortcuts with different arguments are now correctly displayed as individual entries.

### Dark high contrast theme

A new theme, JupyterLab Dark High Contrast, which is intended to benefit users with the need for higher contrast, following the WCAG AAA accessibility standard for color contrast. To select this theme, from the menu bar, choose Settings → Theme → JupyterLab Dark High Contrast. Please provide feedback and suggestions on further improvements to this theme.

This release is compatible with extensions supporting JupyterLab 4.0. Extension authors are recommended to consult the [Extension Migration Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_migration.html#jupyterlab-4-0-to-4-1) which lists deprecations and changes to the public API.

For reference you may have a look at the JupyterLab 4.1 changelog to learn more: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/changelog.html#v4-1

### Diagrams in Markdown

Matching GitHub-Flavoured Markdown, JupyterLab 4.1 now supports [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) diagrams.
To create a mermaid diagram use the `mermaid` language specifier for a code block in a markdown cell or document, for example:

~~~
```mermaid
flowchart LR

A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
B --> C{Decision}
C -->|One| D[Result 1]
C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```
~~~

which renders as:

<img alt="Rendered Mermaid diagram going from left to right with modern look; the diagram contains blueish square node with text Hard pointing to round square node with text Round; over the arrow connecting the two nodes there is a word Text; the second node further connects to a rhombus-shaped node with text Decision which then connects to two further nodes, Result 1 and Result 2." src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.1-merimad-diagram.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Inline completer

JupyterLab now supports completion presented as ghost text in the cell and file editors,
allowing generative AI models to provide multi-line completions. This can now also be leveraged in Jupyter Notebook.

The suggestions are provided by plugins implementing the ``IInlineCompletionProvider`` API;
by default a single provider which uses kernel history is available.

<img alt="In a code cell with `def fac` content a ghost text containing a suggestion representing further code of factorial function is shown; over the code cell there is a floating widget allowing to accept the suggestion and iterate between alternative suggestions" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.1-inline-completer.png" class="jp-screenshot">

The suggestions can be invoked as-you-type or manually using a configurable shortcut (by default <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>\\</kbd>).
The default keyboard shortcuts are displayed in the small widget shown when hovering over the ghost suggestion:
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>End</kbd> - accept suggestion
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd> - previous suggestion
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd> - next suggestion

To enable the inline suggestions based on the kernel history, go to Settings → Inline Completer → History provider → check the "enabled" checkbox.

In addition to the built-in history suggestions,
the [`jupyter-ai`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai) extension will provide
suggestions from supported models.

Note that the Jupyter AI extension is not yet compatible with Jupyter Notebook 7.

### Keyboard navigation improvements

Numerous improvements to keyboard navigation with focus on accessibility and usability are included in this release:
- the notebook cells now retain focus
- the focus can now be moved beyond the active notebook
- the toolbars can now be navigated using arrow keys

For more details, see [this post on Jupyter Blog](https://blog.jupyter.org/recent-keyboard-navigation-improvements-in-jupyter-4df32f97628d).

### Execution history in notebook

The code from previously executed cells can be used to populate empty cells,
allowing to iterate on code from previous cells or even sessions
(depending on how a specific kernel stores history).

To cycle between history items press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> and  <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd>.

To enable execution history, go to Settings → Notebook → check the "Kernel history access" checkbox.

This feature was already available in the console in previous releases; it only works with kernels supporting execution history requests.
To clear the execution history consult the documentation of the kernel you are using (e.g., IPython/ipykernel).

### Error indicator in the table of contents

When a cell fails during execution, an error indicator will be displayed by the corresponding heading,
increasing awareness of the notebook state and enabling users to quickly navigate to the cell which requires attention.

<img alt="Error indicator in the shape of a triangle with exclamation sign (using ⚠ UTF character) shown next to one of the headings in the table of contents panel" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/main/docs/source/getting_started/changelog_assets/4.1-toc-error-indicator.png" class="jp-screenshot">

### Search improvements

- The search box will now grow automatically to accommodate longer text
- Search in selection can now be toggled using <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> and automatic search in selection can be configured in settings
- Tooltips with shortcuts were added to the buttons in the search box to improve discoverability of the shortcuts

### Miscellaneous

- The current theme (dark/light) can now be synced with the browser/system preference (Settings menu → Theme → Synchronise with System Settings)
- A blue "read-only" status indicator is now  displayed in the toolbar of documents which cannot be saved because their model is read-only.
- Native support for viewing jsonl/ndjson files was added
- Collapsing of breadcrumbs in the File Browser can be disabled in File Browser settings

## 6.0

This is the first major release of the Jupyter Notebook since version
5.0 (March 2017).

We encourage users to start trying JupyterLab, which has just announced
it's 1.0 release in preparation for a future transition.

- Remove Python 2.x support in favor of Python 3.5 and higher.
- Multiple accessibility enhancements and bug-fixes.
- Multiple translation enhancements and bug-fixes.
- Remove deprecated ANSI CSS styles.
- Native support to forward requests to Jupyter Gateway(s) (Embedded
  NB2KG).
- Use JavaScript to redirect users to notebook homepage.
- Enhanced SSL/TLS security by using PROTOCOL_TLS which selects the
  highest ssl/tls protocol version available that both the client and
  server support. When PROTOCOL_TLS is not available use
  PROTOCOL_SSLv23.
- Add `?no_track_activity=1` argument to allow API requests. to not be
  registered as activity (e.g. API calls by external activity
  monitors).
- Kernels shutting down due to an idle timeout is no longer considered
  an activity-updating event.
- Further improve compatibility with tornado 6 with improved checks
  for when websockets are closed.
- Launch the browser with a local file which redirects to the server
  address including the authentication token. This prevents another
  logged-in user from stealing the token from command line arguments
  and authenticating to the server. The single-use token previously
  used to mitigate this has been removed. Thanks to Dr. Owain Kenway
  for suggesting the local file approach.
- Respect nbconvert entrypoints as sources for exporters
- Update to CodeMirror to 5.37, which includes f-string syntax for
  Python 3.6.
- Update jquery-ui to 1.12
- Execute cells by clicking icon in input prompt.
- New "Save as" menu option.
- When serving on a loopback interface, protect against DNS rebinding
  by checking the `Host` header from the browser. This check can be
  disabled if necessary by setting `NotebookApp.allow_remote_access`. (Disabled by default while we work out some Mac issues in
  [3754](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3754)).
- Add kernel_info_timeout traitlet to enable restarting slow kernels.
- Add `custom_display_host` config option to override displayed URL.
- Add /metrics endpoint for Prometheus Metrics.
- Optimize large file uploads.
- Allow access control headers to be overridden in
  jupyter_notebook_config.py to support greater CORS and proxy
  configuration flexibility.
- Add support for terminals on windows.
- Add a "restart and run all" button to the toolbar.
- Frontend/extension-config: allow default json files in a .d
  directory.
- Allow setting token via jupyter_token env.
- Cull idle kernels using `--MappingKernelManager.cull_idle_timeout`.
- Allow read-only notebooks to be trusted.
- Convert JS tests to Selenium.

Security Fixes included in previous minor releases of Jupyter Notebook
and also included in version 6.0.

- Fix Open Redirect vulnerability (CVE-2019-10255) where certain
  malicious URLs could redirect from the Jupyter login page to a
  malicious site after a successful login.
- Contains a security fix for a cross-site inclusion (XSSI)
  vulnerability (CVE-2019--9644), where files at a known URL could be
  included in a page from an unauthorized website if the user is
  logged into a Jupyter server. The fix involves setting the
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, and applying CSRF checks
  previously on all non-GET API requests to GET requests to API
  endpoints and the /files/ endpoint.
- Check Host header to more securely protect localhost deployments
  from DNS rebinding. This is a pre-emptive measure, not fixing a
  known vulnerability. Use `.NotebookApp.allow_remote_access` and
  `.NotebookApp.local_hostnames` to configure access.
- Upgrade bootstrap to 3.4, fixing an XSS vulnerability, which has
  been assigned
  [CVE-2018-14041](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14041).
- Contains a security fix preventing malicious directory names from
  being able to execute javascript.
- Contains a security fix preventing nbconvert endpoints from
  executing javascript with access to the server API. CVE request
  pending.

## 5.7.8

- Fix regression in restarting kernels in 5.7.5. The restart handler
  would return before restart was completed.
- Further improve compatibility with tornado 6 with improved checks
  for when websockets are closed.
- Fix regression in 5.7.6 on Windows where .js files could have the
  wrong mime-type.
- Fix Open Redirect vulnerability (CVE-2019-10255) where certain
  malicious URLs could redirect from the Jupyter login page to a
  malicious site after a successful login. 5.7.7 contained only a
  partial fix for this issue.

## 5.7.6

5.7.6 contains a security fix for a cross-site inclusion (XSSI)
vulnerability (CVE-2019--9644), where files at a known URL could be
included in a page from an unauthorized website if the user is logged
into a Jupyter server. The fix involves setting the
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, and applying CSRF checks
previously on all non-GET API requests to GET requests to API endpoints
and the /files/ endpoint.

The attacking page is able to access some contents of files when using
Internet Explorer through script errors, but this has not been
demonstrated with other browsers.

## 5.7.5

- Fix compatibility with tornado 6 ([4392](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/4392), [4449](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/4449)).
- Fix opening integer filedescriptor during startup on Python 2 ([4349](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/4349))
- Fix compatibility with asynchronous
  \[KernelManager.restart_kernel\]{.title-ref} methods ([4412](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/4412))

## 5.7.4

5.7.4 fixes a bug introduced in 5.7.3, in which the
`list_running_servers()` function attempts to parse HTML files as JSON,
and consequently crashes ([4284](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/4284)).

## 5.7.3

5.7.3 contains one security improvement and one security fix:

- Launch the browser with a local file which redirects to the server
  address including the authentication token ([4260](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/4260)). This prevents another logged-in user from stealing
  the token from command line arguments and authenticating to the
  server. The single-use token previously used to mitigate this has
  been removed. Thanks to Dr. Owain Kenway for suggesting the local
  file approach.
- Upgrade bootstrap to 3.4, fixing an XSS vulnerability, which has
  been assigned
  [CVE-2018-14041](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-14041) ([4271](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/4271)).

## 5.7.2

5.7.2 contains a security fix preventing malicious directory names from
being able to execute javascript. CVE request pending.

## 5.7.1

5.7.1 contains a security fix preventing nbconvert endpoints from
executing javascript with access to the server API. CVE request pending.

## 5.7.0

## 5.0.0

This is the first major release of the Jupyter Notebook since version
4.0 was created by the "Big Split" of IPython and Jupyter.

We encourage users to start trying JupyterLab in preparation for a
future transition.

We have merged more than 300 pull requests since 4.0. Some of the major
user-facing changes are described here.

### File sorting in the dashboard

Files in the dashboard may now be sorted by last modified date or name
([943](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/943)):

### Cell tags

There is a new cell toolbar for adding _cell tags_
([2048](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2048)):

Cell tags are a lightweight way to customise the behaviour of tools
working with notebooks; we're working on building support for them into
tools like [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[nbval](https://github.com/computationalmodelling/nbval). To start using
tags, select `Tags` in the `View > Cell Toolbar` menu in a notebook.

The UI for editing cell tags is basic for now; we hope to improve it in
future releases.

### Table style

The default styling for tables in the notebook has been updated
([1776](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1776)).

### Customise keyboard shortcuts

You can now edit keyboard shortcuts for _Command Mode_ within the UI
([1347](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1347)):

See the `Help > Edit Keyboard Shortcuts` menu item and follow the
instructions.

### Other additions

- You can copy and paste cells between notebooks, using
  `Ctrl-C`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} and
  `Ctrl-V`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} (`Cmd-C`{.interpreted-text
  role="kbd"} and `Cmd-V`{.interpreted-text role="kbd"} on Mac).
- It's easier to configure a password for the notebook with the new
  `jupyter notebook password` command ([2007](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2007)).
- The file list can now be ordered by _last modified_ or by _name_ ([943](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/943)).
- Markdown cells now support attachments. Simply drag and drop an
  image from your desktop to a markdown cell to add it. Unlike
  relative links that you enter manually, attachments are embedded in
  the notebook itself. An unreferenced attachment will be
  automatically scrubbed from the notebook on save ([621](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/621)).
- Undoing cell deletion now supports undeleting multiple cells. Cells
  may not be in the same order as before their deletion, depending on
  the actions you did on the meantime, but this should should help
  reduce the impact of accidentally deleting code.
- The file browser now has _Edit_ and _View_ buttons.
- The file browser now supports moving multiple files at once ([1088](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1088)).
- The Notebook will refuse to run as root unless the `--allow-root`
  flag is given ([1115](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1115)).
- Keyboard shortcuts are now declarative ([1234](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1234)).
- Toggling line numbers can now affect all cells ([1312](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1312)).
- Add more visible _Trusted_ and _Untrusted_ notifications ([1658](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1658)).
- The favicon (browser shortcut icon) now changes to indicate when the
  kernel is busy ([1837](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1837)).
- Header and toolbar visibility is now persisted in nbconfig and
  across sessions ([1769](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1769)).
- Load server extensions with ConfigManager so that merge happens
  recursively, unlike normal config values, to make it load more
  consistently with frontend extensions([2108](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/2108)).
- The notebook server now supports the bundler API
  from the [jupyter_cms incubator
  project](https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/contentmanagement) ([1579](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1579)).
- The notebook server now provides information about kernel activity
  in its kernel resource API ([1827](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/1827)).

Remember that upgrading `notebook` only affects the user interface.
Upgrading kernels and libraries may also provide new features, better
stability and integration with the notebook interface.

## 4.4.0

- Allow override of output callbacks to redirect output messages. This
  is used to implement the ipywidgets Output widget, for example.
- Fix an async bug in message handling by allowing comm message
  handlers to return a promise which halts message processing until
  the promise resolves.

involved in this release.

## 4.3.2

4.3.2 is a patch release with a bug fix for CodeMirror and improved
handling of the "editable" cell metadata field.

- Monkey-patch for CodeMirror that resolves
  [#2037](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2037) without
  breaking [#1967](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/1967)
- Read-only (`"editable": false`) cells can be executed but cannot be
  split, merged, or deleted

and [pull
requests](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20milestone%3A4.3.2)
involved in this release.

## 4.3.1

4.3.1 is a patch release with a security patch, a couple bug fixes, and
improvements to the newly-released token authentication.

**Security fix**:

- CVE-2016-9971. Fix CSRF vulnerability, where malicious forms could
  create untitled files and start kernels (no remote execution or
  modification of existing files) for users of certain browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer / Edge). All previous notebook releases
  are affected.

Bug fixes:

- Fix carriage return handling
- Make the font size more robust against fickle browsers
- Ignore resize events that bubbled up and didn't come from window
- Add Authorization to allowed CORS headers
- Downgrade CodeMirror to 5.16 while we figure out issues in Safari

Other improvements:

- Better docs for token-based authentication
- Further highlight token info in log output when autogenerated

See the 4.3.1 milestone on GitHub for a complete list of
[issues](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A4.3.1)
and [pull
requests](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20milestone%3A4.3.1)
involved in this release.

## 4.3.0

4.3 is a minor release with many bug fixes and improvements. The biggest
user-facing change is the addition of token authentication, which is
enabled by default. A token is generated and used when your browser is
opened automatically, so you shouldn't have to enter anything in the
default circumstances. If you see a login page (e.g. by switching
browsers, or launching on a new port with `--no-browser`), you get a
login URL with the token from the command `jupyter notebook list`, which
you can paste into your browser.

Highlights:

- API for creating mime-type based renderer extensions using
  `OutputArea.register_mime_type` and `Notebook.render_cell_output`
  methods. See
  [mimerender-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/mimerender-cookiecutter)
  for reference implementations and cookiecutter.
- Enable token authentication by default. See
  `server_security`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for more details.
- Update security docs to reflect new signature system
- Switched from term.js to xterm.js

Bug fixes:

- Ensure variable is set if exc_info is falsey
- Catch and log handler exceptions in `events.trigger`
- Add debug log for static file paths
- Don't check origin on token-authenticated requests
- Remove leftover print statement
- Fix highlighting of Python code blocks
- `json_errors` should be outermost decorator on API handlers
- Fix remove old nbserver info files
- Fix notebook mime type on download links
- Fix carriage symbol behavior
- Fix terminal styles
- Update dead links in docs
- If kernel is broken, start a new session
- Include cross-origin check when allowing login URL redirects

Other improvements:

- Allow JSON output data with mime type `application/*+json`
- Allow kernelspecs to have spaces in them for backward compat
- Allow websocket connections from scripts
- Allow `None` for post_save_hook
- Upgrade CodeMirror to 5.21
- Upgrade xterm to 2.1.0
- Docs for using comms
- Set `dirty` flag when output arrives
- Set `ws-url` data attribute when accessing a notebook terminal
- Add base aliases for nbextensions
- Include `@` operator in CodeMirror IPython mode
- Extend mathjax_url docstring
- Load nbextension in predictable order

## 4.2.3

4.2.3 is a small bugfix release on 4.2.

> Highlights:

- Fix regression in 4.2.2 that delayed loading custom.js until after
  `notebook_loaded` and `app_initialized` events have fired.
- Fix some outdated docs and links.

## 4.2.2

4.2.2 is a small bugfix release on 4.2, with an important security fix.
All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to 4.2.2.

> Highlights:

- **Security fix**: CVE-2016-6524, where untrusted latex output could
  be added to the page in a way that could execute javascript.
- Fix missing POST in OPTIONS responses.
- Fix for downloading non-ascii filenames.
- Avoid clobbering ssl_options, so that users can specify more
  detailed SSL configuration.
- Fix inverted load order in nbconfig, so user config has highest
  priority.

## 4.2.1

4.2.1 is a small bugfix release on 4.2. Highlights:

- Compatibility fixes for some versions of ipywidgets
- Fix for ignored CSS on Windows
- Fix specifying destination when installing nbextensions

## 4.2.0

Release 4.2 adds a new API for enabling and installing extensions.
Extensions can now be enabled at the system-level, rather than just
per-user. An API is defined for installing directly from a Python
package, as well.

Highlighted changes:

- Upgrade MathJax to 2.6 to fix vertical-bar appearing on some
  equations.
- Restore ability for notebook directory to be root (4.1 regression)
- Large outputs are now throttled, reducing the ability of output
  floods to kill the browser.
- Fix the notebook ignoring cell executions while a kernel is starting
  by queueing the messages.
- Fix handling of url prefixes (e.g. JupyterHub) in terminal and edit
  pages.
- Support nested SVGs in output.

And various other fixes and improvements.

## 4.1.0

Bug fixes:

- Properly reap zombie subprocesses
- Fix cross-origin problems
- Fix double-escaping of the base URL prefix
- Handle invalid unicode filenames more gracefully
- Fix ANSI color-processing
- Send keepalive messages for web terminals
- Fix bugs in the notebook tour

UI changes:

- Moved the cell toolbar selector into the _View_ menu. Added a button
  that triggers a "hint" animation to the main toolbar so users can
  find the new location. (Click here to see a
  [screencast](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/335567/10711889/59665a5a-7a3e-11e5-970f-86b89592880c.gif)
  )

- Added _Restart & Run All_ to the _Kernel_ menu. Users can also bind
  it to a keyboard shortcut on action
  `restart-kernel-and-run-all-cells`.

- Added multiple-cell selection. Users press `Shift-Up/Down` or
  `Shift-K/J` to extend selection in command mode. Various actions
  such as cut/copy/paste, execute, and cell type conversions apply to
  all selected cells.

- Added a command palette for executing Jupyter actions by name. Users
  press `Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-P` or click the new command palette icon on
  the toolbar.

- Added a _Find and Replace_ dialog to the _Edit_ menu. Users can also
  press `F` in command mode to show the dialog.

Other improvements:

- Custom KernelManager methods can be Tornado coroutines, allowing
  async operations.
- Make clearing output optional when rewriting input with
  `set_next_input(replace=True)`.
- Added support for TLS client authentication via
  `--NotebookApp.client-ca`.
- Added tags to `jupyter/notebook` releases on DockerHub. `latest`
  continues to track the master branch.
